# SOS#toast

A "Simple Operating System" kernel, written primarily in Ada 2012 . Some goals of the project are..
- to become familiar with a system architecture (primarily x86_64) in detail.
- to gain experience with bare-metal programming in an unfamiliar language.
- to explore how 'safer' languages might reduce the number of bugs and programmer-introduced flaws in a kernel.
- to experiment with formal verification of system components & design with contract in SPARK 2014 (a subset of Ada).
- to work on with and on structuring a large project, with room for extensibility (e.g. to other targets and architectures).

This repository is the source tree for my final BSc Computer Science project at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam.

It's nickname is `toast`, because `toast` is tasty.
